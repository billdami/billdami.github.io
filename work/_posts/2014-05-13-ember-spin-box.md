ember-spin-box (2014)
=======

A lightweight and versatile spin box component for [ember.js](http://emberjs.com) applications. 

Although the development of this component was intended more as a learning experience for myself,  ember-spin-box received some very positive initial feedback from the community, and was even featured in the e-mail newsletter, [Ember Weekly](http://emberweekly.com/) (issue #60). It was one of my first stabs at creating a truly reusable component that could easily be used in many different applications, and could be built upon to create more complex interfaces. In fact, [ember-date-picker]({% post_url 2014-05-22-ember-date-picker %}) is another component I created, which uses ember-spin-box as its core means of user interaction.
