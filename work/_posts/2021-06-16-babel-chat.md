[babel chat](https://www.babelchat.online) is chat app that I developed as way to experiment with React application development, as well as realtime communication techniques. The app is 100% client-side, built with the [React](https://reactjs.org/) JavaScript library (using [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev)), and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/), a realtime database service. The source code is written 100% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

The app itself was designed to be clean, easy to use, and fast. It uses [tailwindcss](http://tailwindcss.com/) for the UI design, and is mobile-first and fully responsive, working equally well on smartphones, tablets, and desktops.
