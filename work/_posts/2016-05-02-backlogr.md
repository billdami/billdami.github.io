[backlogr](http://billdami.com/backlogr-angular/) is an experimental web app built with angular.js for tracking and managing your video game collection and backlog.

I built this app mainly as a way to get my feet wet with using angular.js, and to explore its strengths and weaknesses when used to create slightly more complex web applications. As a an avid gamer, I thought that an app for tracking your game backlog would be a perfect test and would fit nicely as a traditional "CRUD" type application. To make the app more useful, and to make it come alive a bit more, I've connected it to the excellent [GiantBomb API](http://www.giantbomb.com/api/) and games database. The app makes requests to a custom node.js based REST API that I developed, which serves a cached version of GiantBomb's data from a MongoDB database, which makes searching it from the app even faster and easier, and allows things like the game box art to be incorporated into the interface.

## Key components & features

* Backed by the [GiantBomb games database](http://www.giantbomb.com/api/), cached to a MongoDB database and served from a custom node.js API
* Stores the user's games and configuration data in browser localStorage
* Fully responsive and mobile friendly user interface (built on top of [Bootstrap v4 alpha](http://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/), and uses [fastclick](https://github.com/ftlabs/fastclick) for lag-free touch interaction)
* Uses [ui-router](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router) for page/view routing with URL support
* Custom built combo-box/auto-complete widget directive (for searching the games database)
* Custom built toast notifications directive
* CSS3 Animations with [ngAnimate](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngAnimate) (for modals, dropdowns, notifications, list items)
* Keyboard control support with [angular-hotkeys](https://github.com/chieffancypants/angular-hotkeys)
