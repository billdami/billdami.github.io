[chatterfu.com](http://www.chatterfu.com) is simple chat app that I developed as way to experiment with client-side application design and realtime communication techniques. The app is 100% client-side code, built with the [ember.js](http://emberjs.com) framework, and [firebase](https://www.firebase.com/), a realtime backend service. I also utilized [ember-cli](http://www.ember-cli.com/), a command line interface, as my build pipeline and means of code organization.

The app itself was designed to be clean, easy to use, and fast. It uses [bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) as the foundation for its UI, and is fully responsive, working equally well on smartphones, tablets, and desktops.
