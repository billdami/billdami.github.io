Utime
=======

Utime is an extension for Google Chrome that converts UNIX timestamps to dates (and vice versa).

As a PHP/MySQL developer, I am constantly dealing with unix timestamps on a daily basis. While an efficient way to store dates, they aren't exactly very human-friendly when browsing through database tables and code. This Chrome extension was my attempt to solve that little annoyance, a problem which apparently is shared by many other developers, as the extension has over 25,000 active users at the time of this writing.
