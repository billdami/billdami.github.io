ember-date-picker
=======

<img src="/img/ember-date-picker-hero.png" class="post-hero-img" />

A lightweight, mobile-optimized, date picker component for [ember.js](http://emberjs.com) applications.

Built on top of my [ember-spin-box]({% post_url 2014-05-13-ember-spin-box %}) component, ember-date-picker is a super minimal date picker widget that works equally well on desktop and mobile devices. It eschews the usual calendar-style interface for one more akin to an iOS picker widget, which allows for quick any easy selection via touch or mouse scrolling.
